Players will get to turn the “wheel” by pressing “1” and can end the game anytime and walk away with the earned points anytime by pressing “2”. And as a gift, the players will start with an initial of 50 points. 

Here’s how a player will lose or win points from then on: 

1.	Players will turn the wheel. A random number from 000 to 999 will come up. 
2.	Now, if the max digit of the random number is a prime number, the player will win “MaxPrimeNumber” X 10 points. For example, if the random number is 237, then the maximum digit is 7. 7 is a prime number. So, the player will win 7 X 10 = 70 points. 
For this game, to ensure the player wins points, treat 0 and 1 like prime numbers. 
3.	At the same time, if the min digit of the random number is a prime number, the player will win “MinPrimeNumber” X 5 points. For example, if the random number is 237, then the minimum digit is 2. 2 is a prime number. So the player will win 2 X 5 = 10 points. 
4.	IF the max digit isn’t prime, the player will lose 40 points.
5.	And IF the min digit isn’t prime, the player will lose 20 points. 
6.	At each round, the points will be calculated based on all of the above-mentioned rules. So for example, if in a round, the random number is 128. Then-
a) The min digit is 1, which will be treated as a prime number. So the player will win 1 X 5 = 5 points. 
b) The max digit is 4, which is not prime. So the player will lose 40 points. 
c) So, in this round, the total earned point is +5 - 40 = -35. 
7.	In this way, points will keep on being updated after each round. Players can exit anytime with their current winnings by pressing “2”.
